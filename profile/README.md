# Sailing Ranking

## Project Information

### Context
Sailing is a competitive and popular sport throughout the world. It is an official summer olympic competition. A sailing competition takes place over one or multiple days, in which one or more races are executed during the competition. 

The goal of the competition is to accumulate the least amount of points in order to win. When a competitor crosses the finish line they are awarded the amount of points equivalent to their finishing position (the first competitor to finish gets one point and so on).

The way the finishing positions and points are being noted for each race is as follows: At the finish line an official from the jury has a notebook and writes down the unique sail number of the competitor when they cross the line. Later once the jury comes to shore they manually copy the handwritten sail numbers over to an excel sheet that handles executing the necessary calculations, and generates the new standings of the competition.

The process at the moment is labour intensive and time consuming. When people of the jury spend hours on the water and later have to spend time copying the sail number from their notebook to a computer, it is prone to long waiting time and errors.
